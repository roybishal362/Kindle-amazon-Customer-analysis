## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning and NLP methods to classify customer reviews for Kindle products on Amazon. By understanding customer sentiment, businesses can leverage these insights to enhance customer experience, improve products, and boost satisfaction.

## Dataset
The dataset can be found [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/meetnagadia/amazon-kindle-book-sentiment-analysis). It includes the following columns:
- **Review Text**: The actual customer review.
- **Star Rating**: The rating given by the customer (1-5 stars).
- **Verified Purchase**: Indicates whether the review was written by a verified purchaser.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:


pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk wordcloud matplotlib seaborn

For training machine learning models, you will also need:

bash
Copy code
pip install xgboost lightgbm
Notebook Structure
The Jupyter notebook is structured as follows:

Loading Data: Importing the dataset and performing initial exploratory data analysis.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and tokenizing the review text, handling missing data, and preparing the dataset for training.
Feature Extraction: Converting text data to numerical form using TF-IDF and Word2Vec embeddings.
Model Training: Training machine learning models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM) to classify sentiments.
Model Evaluation: Analyzing model performance using evaluation metrics and visualizations.
Approach
1. Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning: Removing punctuation, special characters, and stopwords from the review text.
Tokenization: Splitting review text into individual tokens (words).
Handling Missing Data: Dropping or filling any missing values in the dataset.
2. Feature Extraction
TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency): Quantifies the importance of words in the document corpus.
Word2Vec Embeddings: Creates word vectors to capture semantic meanings and relationships between words.
3. Model Training
We train the following models:

Logistic Regression: Used as a baseline classifier.
XGBoost: A gradient-boosting model known for high performance.
LightGBM: Another gradient-boosting model optimized for large datasets and faster computation.
4. Model Evaluation
Confusion Matrix: To visualize true positives, false positives, and false negatives for each class.
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Used as the main metrics to evaluate model performance.
Feature Importance Plot: Visualizes the most impactful features for the classification models.
Results
The XGBoost model achieved the highest performance with an F1-score of 0.85 and accuracy of 87%. The most important words influencing sentiment classification were visualized using word clouds and feature importance plots.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the utility of machine learning and NLP techniques in analyzing customer sentiment from text data. The insights derived from this analysis can help businesses improve products and customer experiences. Future work could involve applying deep learning models (e.g., RNNs or Transformers) to further improve the accuracy of sentiment classification.
